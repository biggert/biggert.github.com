So this is random but required too much Googling to figure out so I thought I'd post it to make it easier for others like me who had to hunt this down. The post that I eventually found is <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-pictures/after-disabling-the-speakers-in-sound-control/df4e5343-e708-49c2-8fde-97192a7a21c6">here</a>.

So if you open the sound control panel either through control panel or right-click the speaker icon and choose playback or recording devices, you will see a list of those devices. If you right-click one and select disable, it will disappear from that list. To get the device back, it is definitely not apparent.

Following the post above, you bring up the list and right-click in the whitespace and you'll see a 'Show disabled devices'. Click this and you have access to re-enabling the device again!
