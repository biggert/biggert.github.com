So I've been doing this for a while manually (especially considering the <a href="http://madskristensen.net/post/Tips-for-working-with-strings-in-C-20.aspx">performance benefit</a> of UPPERINVARIANT over LOWERINVARIANT)Â  but recently took the time to Google and see if there's an automated way to do this and alas, there is. Google sent me to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/2007/08/28/did-you-know-there-s-a-keyboard-shortcut-default-to-upper-and-lower-case-a-word-in-the-editor.aspx">Sara Ford's blog</a> where it mentions the shortcuts.
<ul>
	<li>Press Ctrl+Shift+U to make the current character or selected characters uppercase</li>
	<li>Press Ctrl+U to make the current character or selected characters lowercase</li>
</ul>
Good to know!
